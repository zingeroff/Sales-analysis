# Restaurant Sales Optimization & Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer behavior data from a fast-food restaurant chain to uncover actionable insights that support marketing and operational decisions.

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify high-value and at-risk customers through RFM segmentation
- Visualize retention patterns with cohort analysis
- Evaluate purchase behavior and lifetime value dynamics
- Provide a data-driven foundation for re-engagement and loyalty campaigns

## 📊 Key Analyses

### 1. RFM Segmentation
Customers are segmented based on:
- **Recency** – how recently they purchased
- **Frequency** – how often they purchased
- **Monetary** – how much they spent

This approach helps identify champions, loyalists, new active users, and at-risk customers, enabling targeted marketing and retention strategies.

### 2. Cohort Retention Analysis
Cohort-based retention tracking reveals how long customers continue to engage after their first order. Results are exported in a Tableau-friendly format for dashboard visualization.

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value
Basic CLV and CAC efficiency insights help align acquisition strategies with long-term profitability goals.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- SQL (for data preparation)
- Tableau (for final reporting and visualization)
